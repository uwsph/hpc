# Look for R and see which version it is.

R --version

# It's an older version: R-4.3.3. I need R-4.4+.

# Install latest R-4.4.1 using these instructions:
# https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/

# Look for R Studio.
whereis rstudio

# None found.

# Install latest R Studio Desktop as follows:
sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module -y
wget 'https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/jammy/amd64/rstudio-2024.04.2-764-amd64.deb'
sudo apt update
sudo dpkg -i ./rstudio-2024.04.2-764-amd64.deb
sudo apt -f install
sudo chmod 4755 /usr/lib/rstudio/chrome-sandbox

# Install dependencies for my example R project.
sudo apt install gsfonts imagemagick libmagick++-dev -y

# The packages installed above put binaries in /usr/bin.

# Test as follows:
git clone https://github.com/brianhigh/gisaid_and_parsnp_demo.git
export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH

# Create an R Studio "project" for this repo and run the code
# to install R packages: package_installer.R. Then run the other 
# R scripts which do the analysis and create the figures. Once 
# this works on the head node, try on a compute node.

# To run on compute nodes, you first need to install dependencies  
# on the compute nodes. To do that, Robert has setup a utility "cssh".
# With this, install R, rstudio, and system dependencies as above but 
# using the "cssh" tool as described below.

xauth list       # Copy the contents of the last line printed out
sudo -i          # To get a root bash prompt
xauth add [...]  # Where [...] is the line copied from xauth list
cssh nodes       # To get a gui for bash commands to run on all compute 
                 # nodes and also open an xterm for each compute node.
                 # Close gui when you are done w/ compute node setup 
                 # and this will also close the xterm for each node.

# Connect to a compute node as a regular user and then run analysis.
